# Angel One MCP (Model Context Protocol) + Upstox (Planned)

This repository contains the Model Context Protocol implementation for Angel One trading platform, with Upstox integration planned for future releases. The MCP allows you to interact with trading APIs to get historical data and portfolio information.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10
- Angel One trading account
- API credentials from Angel One

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/angelone-mcp.git
cd angelone-mcp
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

1. Create a test_credentials.py file in the root directory with your Angel One credentials:
```python
# test_credentials.py
API_KEY = "your_api_key"
CLIENT_CODE = "your_client_code"
PASSWORD = "your_password"
PIN = "your_pin"
TOKEN = "your_token"  # Optional
```

## Usage

1. You can start `api.py` as an mcp server to your mcp client
```json
{
    "mcp": {
        "servers": {
            "angleone": {
                "command": "/Users/rohandoshi/.local/bin/uv",
                "args": [

                    "/Users/rohandoshi/Development/angelone-mcp",
                    "run",
                    "api.py"
